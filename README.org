* gophwr v0.5
  A graphical gopher browser in =racket/gui=.

*** Project goals
    My aim is to create a decent gopher client suitable for daily use without
    resorting to web technologies. No HTML nor CSS under the hood.

** How to use
   Install Racket, then run:

   ~% racket src/main.rkt [--tls] [address]~

   Alternatively, fetch a [[https://github.com/erkin/gophwr/releases][binary release]] (might be outdated) and run it:

   ~% bin/gophwr [--tls] [address]~

   To configure it, copy the example [[assets/gophwr.rktd][config file]] to your Racket preferences
   directory. See more [[https://github.com/erkin/gophwr/wiki/Config-file][on the wiki]].

** Status
   This project is still a work in progress, expect occasional breakage.
   Patches and feedback welcome.

**** The way it looks as of v0.5.2
