* gophwr v0.3
  A graphical gopher browser in =racket/gui=.

*** Project goals
    My aim is to create a decent gopher client suitable for daily use without
    resorting to web technologies. No HTML nor CSS under the hood.

** How to use
   ~% racket src/main.rkt [--tls] [address]~

** Status
   This project is still under construction, expect occasional breakage.
   Patches welcome.

**** The way it looks as of v0.3.4

** Dependencies
   =net-lib= is used only for =send-url= (for =h= selectors) and can also be
   effortlessly removed. Besides that, it's just =gui-lib=.

*** TLS
   Depends on =lib{crypto,ssl}.{so,dll,dylib}= for TLS, although TLS
   functionality can be trivially diked out if necessary.

*** GTK
    On systems besides Windows and macOS, if your system has GTK 3, it will
    try to use that. Otherwise, it will fall back on GTK 2. To force it to
    use GTK 2, set the environment variable =PLT_GTK2=.
