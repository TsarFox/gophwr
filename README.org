* gophwr v0.3
  A graphical gopher browser in =racket/gui=.

*** Project goals
    My aim is to create a decent gopher client suitable for daily use without
    resorting to web technologies. No HTML nor CSS under the hood.

** How to use
   ~% racket src/main.rkt [--tls] [address]~

** Status
   This project is still under construction and is barely functional.
   Patches welcome.

   The way it looks as of v0.3.1:

*** Features

*** Work in progress
    + TLS support

    + Options menu

    + Bookmarks
    + Tabbed navigation
    + Find in page

** Dependencies
   Depends on =lib{crypto,ssl}.{so,dll,dylib}= for TLS, although it can be
   trivially diked out if necessary.

   =net-lib= is used only for =send-url= (for =h= selectors) and can also be
   effortlessly removed. Besides these, it's just =gui-lib=.

*** GTK
    If your system has GTK 3, it will try to use that. Otherwise, it will fall
    back on GTK 2. To force it to use GTK 2, set the environment variable
    =PLT_GTK2=.
