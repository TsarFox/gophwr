* gophwr v0.3
  A graphical gopher browser in =racket/gui=.

*** Project goals
    My aim is to create a decent gopher client suitable for daily use without
    resorting to web technologies. No HTML nor CSS under the hood.

** How to use
   ~% racket src/main.rkt [--tls] [address]~

** Status
   This project is still under construction, expect occasional breakage.
   Patches welcome.

**** The way it looks as of v0.3.4
