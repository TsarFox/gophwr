* gophwr v0.3
  A graphical gopher browser in =racket/gui=.

*** Project goals
    My aim is to create a decent gopher client suitable for daily use without
    resorting to web technologies. No HTML nor CSS under the hood.

** How to use
   ~% racket src/main.rkt~

** Status
   This project is still under construction and is barely functional.
   Patches welcome.

   The way it looks as of v0.3.1

*** Work in progress
    + TLS support
    + Themes
      + Font settings
      + Customisable colours
    + Mouseover links

*** Up next
    + Render images
    + Keyboard shortcuts
    + Bookmarks
    + Tabbed navigation

** Dependencies
   Depends on =openssl= module for TLS, although it can be trivially diked out
   if necessary. =net-lib= is used only for =send-url= (for =h= selectors) and
   can also be effortlessly removed. Besides these, it's just =gui-lib=.
