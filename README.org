* gophwr v0.5
  A graphical gopher browser in =racket/gui=.

*** Project goals
    My aim is to create a decent gopher client suitable for daily use without
    resorting to web technologies. No HTML nor CSS under the hood.

** Status
   This project is still a work in progress, expect occasional breakage.
   Patches and feedback welcome.

**** The way it looks as of v0.5.2

** Usage
*** How to run
    Install Racket, then run:

    ~% racket src/main.rkt [--tls] [address]~

    (Running ~% raco make src/main.rkt~ beforehand can make it launch faster.)

    If you don't want to install Racket, you can fetch a [[https://github.com/erkin/gophwr/releases][binary release]] (might be outdated) and run it:

    ~% bin/gophwr [--tls] [address]~

    To configure it, copy the example [[assets/gophwr.rktd][config file]] to your Racket preferences
    directory. See more [[https://github.com/erkin/gophwr/wiki/Config-file][on the wiki]].

*** Installation
    You can install it directly to your local Racket setup:

    ~% raco pkg install --user https://github.com/erkin/gophwr.git~

    Alternatively, if you're using the Nix package manager, simply run
    ~% nix-build~
    in the repo and it will build a package for you.
